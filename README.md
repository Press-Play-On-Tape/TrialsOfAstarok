### todo list

- ~~Make sure to not invert the gfx of the ennemies in the above levels~~
- Maybe make the lava pit and fireball come from the holes in the level instead?
- Have the jumps relative to how long you press jump
- Make it so that the player can get a jump boost when bouncing off ennemies if player pressed the jump button right when touching the ennemy
- Make the Fireball invincible.
- Add a way to generate a treasure chest sometimes in levels that will give a heart.
- Have collision damage actually working
- Add a quick story intro explaining that after the fall of Astarok, people from the village are hosting an event each year to elect a champion by competing to know who can get the furthest in the Trials of Astarok
