# Trials of Astarok
### todo list

- ~~Make sure to not invert the gfx of the ennemies in the above levels~~
- ~~Maybe make the lava pit and fireball come from the holes in the level instead?~~
- ~~Have the jumps relative to how long you press jump~~
- ~~Make it so that the player can get a jump boost when bouncing off ennemies if player pressed the jump button right when touching the ennemy~~
- ~~Make the Fireball invincible.~~
- ~~Add a way to generate a treasure chest sometimes in levels that will give a heart.~~
- ~~Have collision damage actually working~~
- ~~Add a quick story intro explaining that after the fall of Astarok, people from the village are hosting an event each year to elect a champion by competing to know who can get the furthest in the Trials of Astarok~~
- ~~Make it so to just make the score go up. Not go down if moving back~~ 
- ~~Fix a bug that make the start of the level do a weird garbled gfx for a second.~~
- ~~Make it so that holding jump doesn't auto-jump~~
- ~~Remove the current Game Over screen and just use the new Trial Over gfx we now have~~
- ~~Add basic sfx~~
- ~~Reuse the explosion gfx when we defeat an ennemy~~
- ~~Would be great if we could make it less weird for the buttons to use to when going from screen to screen, start screen to Game, game over to high screen, etc... (right now it feels like sometime we are forced to use A and sometimes force to use B without real reasons, could be just me.~~
- ~~Maybe make a selector to select Game Start or High Score on the title screen instead of just a button to get to the high score screen~~
- ~~Make sure the player is facing the right way at all time. When jumping i noticed the player is stuck facing the way he was at first but doesn't face properly when facing the other way during that same jump.~~
- ~~Sometimes we change level even when not going thru the doors~~
- ~~Add a way to reset the scores.~~
- ~~Maybe just make it so we show only the top 3 scores and display the rune combinations and the scores for each instead of initials?~~
- ~~Fireball collision hit box needs to be smaller a little, when on a ledge, even if the player dont touch the fireball he still gets hit.~~
- ~~Sometimes after dying, player dont get a gameover and gets right back in the game... ( Weirdly enough it show all hearts full when that happens)~~
- Need theme.
